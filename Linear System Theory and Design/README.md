Course Projoct, 2018 Fall, NTNU

# Helicopter Lab
- Derived a linear system model of the helicopter for control purposes in the real time.
- Monovariable control: Derived a PID controller for pitch control and a PI controller for travel rate.
- Multivariable control: Used pole placement to design linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and included integral effect.
- Output feedback control: Using pole placement of closed-loop observor gain, designed a linear state estimator by measuring the pitch angle, the elevation angle and the travel angle. 

# Boat Lab
- Derived a system model of the boat influenced by stochastic signals (current disturbance, wave disturbance, and measurement noise).
- Designed a PD controller for heading control.
- Designed a Discrete Kalman filter for wave filtering and estimation of disturbances.

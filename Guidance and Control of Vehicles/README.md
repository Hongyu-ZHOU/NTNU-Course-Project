# Guidance-and-Control-of-Vehicles
Course Project, Fall 2019, NTNU

# Assignment 1: Straight-line path following in the horizontal plane
- Used a Nomoto model for a ship and derived a PID controller to control the cross-track error.

# Assignment 2: Aircraft Autopilot Design with State Estimation
- Designed an autopilot for course hold using aileron as input and successive loop closure.
- Designed a Kalman filter for state estimation.

# Assignment 3: Autopilots for Path Following/Tracking
- Designed a heading controller and a speed controller.
- Implemented a guidance law calculating desired heading and speed.
